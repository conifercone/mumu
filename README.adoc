[quote]

Although there are many mature backend management systems on the market, my strong preference for clean code has made it difficult to find a suitable project.
So, I decided to create my own open-source backend management system that is both clean and feature-complete.
This led to the creation of "mumu," named after my son (沐沐).
Just as I hope for my child's healthy growth, I also wish for the mumu project to thrive.
For as long as I live, this project will remain free and open-source for both individuals and organizations to use without any charges.
