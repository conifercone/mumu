== Explanation

- `<type>`: indicates the type of the commit, which can be one of the following:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Fix the problem
- `docs`: Document update
- `style`: Code style (no changes that affect functionality)
- `refactor`: Refactor code (function has not changed)
- `perf`: Performance optimization
- `test`: Test related changes
- `build`: Build related changes
- `ci`: CI configuration modification
- `chore`: Miscellaneous changes
- `revert`: Undo the change

- `<scope>`: The module or function that indicates the influence, can be in lowercase letters or can contain Chinese.
For example: `user`, `auth`, `Login function`.

- `<subject>`: A short description of the submission, with a maximum length of 50 characters.
The description should be concise and clear, and the first letter should be capitalized.

- `<body>`: Optional section, fill in a more detailed description, up to 72 characters per line, explaining why this change needs to be made, how to solve the problem, and whether there are side effects.

- `<footer>`: Optional section, usually containing a ticket link related to the submission, for example: `Closes #11`.
If it is a destructive update, it should be noted here, for example: `BREAKING CHANGE: Content`.
